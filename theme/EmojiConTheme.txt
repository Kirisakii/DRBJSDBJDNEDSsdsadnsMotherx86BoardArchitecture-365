Generate a Discord server template with categories and channels. Strictly Format the output as follows:

Category: <Category Name>
- Channel: <Channel Name> (Private)
- Channel: <Channel Name> (Read_Only)
- Channel: <Channel Name>
- Voice: <Voice Channel Name> (Private)
- Voice: <Voice Channel Name>

General Insrtuctions:
- Ensure the template includes categories for General, Community, Gaming, Support, and Off-topic, each with relevant channels. Mark channels that should be private with "(Private)" and channels that are read-only for verified members with "(Read_Only)". Voice channels should be explicitly marked with "Voice:". Typically, server information channels such as rules, self roles, and misc info are marked as "Read_Only". Include voice channels in relevant categories.
- Ensure the theme goes like this : where some channels of a particular category are named in this way: <emoji ┃ channelname>, some are named in this way: <emoji ┇ channelname> and some are named in this way <emoji ・ channelname>, make sure to use these "┃", "┇", "・" for aesthetic channel creation. Example : 🏠┃community, 💬┇general, 🖌️・media, etc. make sure you use different and suitable emoji for each channel.
- A typical discord has these categories in the following order. welcome, server info, channels, commands, logs, moderation, etc.
