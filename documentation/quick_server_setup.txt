quick_server_setup Command: (Slash Command)
   - This command generates a server structure template based on a description provided by the user.
   - It validates the selected theme and checks if the server has community features enabled if a community theme is selected.
   - After deferring the interaction, it loads the instructions from the selected theme file and combines them with the user's description.
   - It then sends the generated template for confirmation and waits for the user's confirmation before proceeding to create the server structure.
